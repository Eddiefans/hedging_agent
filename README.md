# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Hedging

A sophisticated framework for applying deep reinforcement learning to portfolio hedging strategies. This project implements continuous control algorithms to optimize hedging decisions for a single-stock portfolio (NVIDIA) over dynamic time periods.

## Overview

This project revolutionizes portfolio hedging by framing it as a continuous control problem where an RL agent learns to dynamically adjust portfolio positions based on market conditions. Key innovations include:

- **Continuous Action Space**: Agent outputs values between 0-2, where 1.0 is neutral, <1.0 indicates short positions, and >1.0 indicates long positions
- **Dynamic Episode Training**: Each episode randomly selects a 6-month period from historical data for robust learning
- **Dead Zone Implementation**: ±9% dead zone around neutral (0.91-1.09) prevents overtrading
- **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: Advanced technical indicators and market context features
- **Multiple Algorithm Support**: Both PPO and SAC implementations for different control paradigms

## Key Features

### Environment Design
- **Continuous Control**: Actions between 0-2 map to portfolio positions from -100% (short) to +200% (leveraged long)
- **Random Episode Sampling**: Each training episode uses a random 6-month period for diverse market exposure
- **Realistic Trading Costs**: Commission fees and position limits
- **Comprehensive Observations**: Multi-timeframe technical indicators and market context

### Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: SMA/EMA across multiple windows (10, 20, 50 days)
- **Momentum Indicators**: RSI, MACD, ROC across various periods
- **Volatility Features**: ATR, Bollinger Bands, rolling volatility measures
- **Market Context**: VIX, SPY correlation, sector rotation signals
- **Volume Analysis**: OBV, VWAP, volume ratios
- **Seasonal Features**: Month, day-of-week, and quarterly effects

### Algorithm Support
- **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**: Superior for continuous control with entropy regularization
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Stable policy gradient method with clipping

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Eddiefans/hedging_agent
cd portfolio_hedging

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install PyTorch (CPU version)
pip install -r torch-requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Data Preparation

Download and process NVIDIA data with comprehensive features:

```bash
python src/data/processor.py
```

This creates a rich feature set including:
- Lagged returns and momentum indicators
- Multi-timeframe moving averages
- Volatility and risk measures
- Market context (VIX, SPY correlation)
- Volume and liquidity indicators

### 2. Model Training

Train a hedging agent using SAC (recommended for continuous control):

```bash
# Train SAC model (best for continuous control)
python src/training/train.py --algorithm SAC --timesteps 1000000

# Or train PPO model
python src/training/train.py --algorithm PPO --timesteps 1000000

# Custom episode length
python src/training/train.py --algorithm SAC --episode_months 3 --timesteps 2000000
```

### 3. Backtesting

Evaluate your trained model across multiple random episodes:

```bash
python src/evaluation/backtest.py --model_path models/best_model/best_model --n_episodes 100
```

## Environment Details

### Action Space
- **Range**: [0.0, 2.0] (continuous)
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0.0-0.91: Short positions (e.g., 0.5 = 50% short)
  - 0.91-1.09: Dead zone (no action)
  - 1.09-2.0: Long positions (e.g., 1.5 = 150% long)

### Observation Space
- **Window Size**: Configurable (default: 5 days)
- **Features**: 50+ technical and market indicators
- **Normalization**: Features are scaled and normalized for stable learning

### Reward Function
- **Primary**: Step returns from position changes
- **Penalties**: Extreme position penalties to encourage reasonable hedging
- **Risk Adjustment**: Volatility-adjusted returns

## Performance Monitoring

### TensorBoard Integration
Monitor training progress in real-time:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/tensorboard
```

Key metrics tracked:
- Episode returns and Sharpe ratios
- Position distributions
- Trading frequency
- Risk-adjusted performance

### Comprehensive Backtesting
The backtesting framework provides:
- **Return Analysis**: Distribution of episode returns vs benchmark
- **Risk Metrics**: Sharpe ratios, max drawdown, volatility
- **Trading Behavior**: Position analysis, trade frequency
- **Market Comparison**: Performance vs buy-and-hold NVIDIA

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Episode Lengths
Experiment with different investment horizons:

```python
# 3-month episodes for short-term hedging
env = PortfolioHedgingEnv(features, prices, episode_length_months=3)

# 12-month episodes for long-term strategies
env = PortfolioHedgingEnv(features, prices, episode_length_months=12)
```

### Model Comparison
Compare different algorithms:

```python
from src.evaluation.backtest import compare_models

models = {
    'SAC': 'models/sac_hedging_final/sac_hedging_final',
    'PPO': 'models/ppo_hedging_final/ppo_hedging_final'
}

comparison = compare_models(models, 'data/processed/NVDA_hedging_features.csv')
```

### Custom Feature Engineering
Extend the feature set:

```python
# Add custom indicators
df['custom_momentum'] = df['Close'].pct_change(21)  # Monthly momentum
df['volatility_regime'] = df['ATR'].rolling(30).rank() / 30  # Volatility regime
```

## Expected Performance

Based on backtesting with NVIDIA data (2015-2024):

- **Average Episode Return**: Target 8-15% over 6-month periods
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Typically 1.2-2.0 for well-trained models
- **Win Rate vs Buy-Hold**: 60-70% of episodes outperform benchmark
- **Max Drawdown**: Generally <10% during 6-month episodes
- **Position Efficiency**: Smart use of short/long positions based on market conditions

## Research Applications

This framework supports research in:
- **Adaptive Hedging**: Dynamic position sizing based on market volatility
- **Regime Detection**: Learning to identify market regimes for hedging
- **Multi-Asset Hedging**: Extend to portfolios with multiple securities
- **Alternative Data**: Incorporate sentiment, news, or macro indicators
- **Risk Parity**: Learn risk-balanced portfolio allocations
